## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Overview

The project started with a dataset of **50,000 Total Employees**. The initial analysis established the following critical metrics:

| Metric | Value | Context / Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Employees** | **50,000** | Total population analyzed. |
| **Attrition Count** | **25,105** | The raw number of employees who have left. |
| **Attrition Rate** | **50.21%** | The critical retention metric identified in the presentation's overview. |
| **Active Employees** | **24,895** | The current size of the workforce. |
| **Average Age** | **39** | The mean age of the overall employee population. |
| **Job Satisfaction** | **2.5 (Average Score)** | The organization-wide average for job contentment. |

## üîç Key Observations & Data-Driven Insights

Based on the detailed analysis across the dashboards (Power BI and Tableau), the following key observations were made:

1.  **High Attrition in Early Career:** Attrition is disproportionately high, concentrated in the **early career stage (1‚Äì3 years)** of employment.
2.  **Age and Marital Status Risk:** **Younger employees (18‚Äì37)** and those who are **married** show a higher overall rate of attrition.
3.  **Departmental Turnover:** Departments with client-facing or high-demand responsibilities (**Sales and Research & Development**) experience the highest rates of turnover.
4.  **Influence of Soft Factors:** Employee retention is directly influenced by factors such as **Work-Life Balance**, **Job and Environmental Satisfaction**, and the **Manager Relationship**.
5.  **Gender Parity in Attrition:** Attrition rates between male and female employees are nearly equal.

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

The analysis led to five strategic recommendations aimed at improving retention and organizational health:

1.  **Targeted Retention Programs:** Design specific programs focused on high-risk employee segments (e.g., employees with 1-3 years of tenure).
2.  **Department-Specific Actions:** Implement tailored interventions (e.g., workload redistribution, hiring support) for high-turnover departments like Sales and R&D.
3.  **Employee Engagement & Satisfaction:** Launch initiatives to address low satisfaction scores and improve the overall work environment.
4.  **Retention Incentives:** Introduce financial or non-financial incentives tied to longer tenure and high performance.
5.  **Improve Work-Life Balance:** Review and adjust policies related to working hours and remote work flexibility to enhance overall wellbeing.
